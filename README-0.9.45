Release Notes for EmberMUD v0.9.45
----------------------------------
I'm not even going to attempt to count the number of new features,
changes, and bug fixes that are in v0.9.45 over v0.9.44...  Here 
is a list of the highlights (this is nowhere near a complete 
list - as usual, check the Changelog to see everything).

  Socials and Helps can now be edited using OLC.

  who format re-worked to compress the space used by AFK, PK, etc.

  Furniture is now sittable, sleepable, etc.

  Fixed several crash bugs in whois, switch, auctions, factions,
    jail, wizgrant, clan channel, spouse channel, and other places.

  Portal and Nexus code is in.

  TRACK_IS_SKILL actually works now.

  The OOC and GOSSIP channels can now be renamed.

  Added lots of new configuration options to config.h

  A new 'shell' command is available on Unix systems.  In the
    default config.h, it is only available at MAX_LEVEL. Please
    note that it's still considered somewhat unstable and may
    crash your MUD.

  Fix a bunch of bugs in resets.

... Just do yourself a favor and read through the Changelog. 8-)

PLEASE NOTE!!!!

  If you are upgrading from EmberMUD v0.9.44a, you will need to 
convert your area files to a new format.  The converter will be
made available for download from our SourceForge site or on
www.embermud.org.

I'd like to take this opportunity to announce that Dorzak has
joined the EmberMUD development team!  He has been contributing
a lot already, and we have plans for him to do much much more.

The official EmberMUD homepage has moved...  The company that
controls the .cx domain has changed and the new company no
longer wishes to give domains out for free to open source
projects! <sigh>  The new hompage is:

Simple enough, huh?  Please note that our contact e-mail addresses
have changed as well.  Here's the latest listing.
